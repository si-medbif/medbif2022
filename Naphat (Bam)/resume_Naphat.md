## Summary
My name is Naphat Sanguansakpakdee (Bam). I am a mathematics graduate from Faculty of Science, Mahidol University under sponsorship of DPST scholarship (Development and Promotion of Science and Technology Talent Scholarship dpst.ipst.ac.th).,

For my background, I have done several mathematics projects including social and environmental issues with MATLAB, and deep learning in computer vision using Python.
I also have hands-on experiences with commercialized deep learning for image recognition software, from five-months internship at YPB group International Co., Ltd.
Ultimately, I plan to pursue Precision Medicine research field throughout my MS and PhD and hopefully in my career during obligated work for DPST scholarship.
